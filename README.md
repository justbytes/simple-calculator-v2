# Simple Calculator v2

## Overview

A calculator DApp that was built with React.js, Hardhat, Solidity. The front-end is hosted through [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) and the contract is deployed to the [zkSync](https://zksync.io/) Goerli Testnet2. This DApp requires a MetaMask account in order to use the calculator and must be [configured](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/fundamentals/testnet.html#connecting-metamask) for the zksync testnet.
